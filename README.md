# ðŸš¢ Titanic Survival Prediction App

An interactive Machine Learning web app built using **Streamlit** that predicts whether a passenger would have survived the Titanic disaster, based on user input features such as **Pclass**, **Sex**, **Siblings/Spouses**, **Parents/Children**, **Fare**, and **Port of Embarkation**.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project uses the Titanic dataset to:
- Perform **data cleaning**
- Conduct **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Apply **feature engineering**
- Train a **Random Forest Classifier**
- Build a deployed web app that predicts survival

ðŸŽ¯ **Model Accuracy**: Achieved **0.83 (83%)** accuracy on the test set.
